# Linux Monitoring and Centralized Logging Platform

This project sets up a Linux-based monitoring and logging stack using open-source tools:
- **Prometheus & Node Exporter** for system metrics monitoring
- **Grafana** for dashboard visualization
- **Rsyslog, Logrotate, Logwatch** for centralized log collection, rotation, and reporting
- **Cron** for automation of daily log reports

## Components

- `prometheus/`: Configuration for Prometheus
- `grafana/`: Instructions for Grafana setup
- `node-exporter/`: Setup script for Node Exporter
- `logging/`: Guides for Rsyslog, Logrotate, Logwatch, and Cron
- `scripts/`: Setup scripts
